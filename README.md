# Project for Learning OpenGL

This is just a simple project for me to (re-)learn OpenGL via the very popular website https://www.learnopengl.com. I never quite finished the original tutorial, and I'm not very confident in graphics programming at all. At the time I failed to implement shadows. Starting from scratch should be fun. ~~I know nobody cares but whatever.~~


## Tools
Currently using Visual Studio 2019 (Visual Studio 16).

---

Using several external libraries, currently:
- GLFW (v3.3.2) — built from source.
- GLAD — include-only, built online (?)
- stb_image — directly included in project
- GLM (v0.9.9.8) — include-only
- Assimp (v5.0.1) — built from source | dynamically-linked.
